This project's code of conduct is documented in the [Chef Community
Guidelines](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc020-community-guidelines.md).

Paraphrasing and excerpting from these guidelines, we would like to
reaffirm some of those beliefs here:

* Diversity is one of our biggest strengths.
* We are welcoming, inclusive, friendly, and patient.
* We are considerate.
* We are respectful.
* We are professional.
* We are careful in the words that we choose.
* When we disagree, we all work together to understand why.
* YOU are welcome here!

Borrowing from the ubuntu philosophy:

> I am because you are.
> When you suffer, I suffer.
> When you thrive, I thrive.
